The quantitative analysis of a public transport network plays a vital role in assessing its efficiency and identifying the areas in need of improvement. 

Focusing on the city of Milan, this project aims to evaluate its transport system in terms of stops density and proximity, rides frequency and variety, with an eye towards people with disabilities as well, by developing a set of indicators that can potentially allow a comparison not only between areas within the city but also between different cities. 

Density and proximity provide insights into how well stops are distributed throughout the city and how easily accessible they are to both the residents and visitors, while frequency and variety permit to understand how well the system caters to the needs of the commuters during the day. 

These metrics have been applied on 12 different 2-hour time slots, allowing us to highlight how some areas, especially in the southwest of the city, may require some improvements since they lack, primarly, proximity and density. Unexpectedly even some central neighborhoods like Navigli and Tre Torri sometimes fail to reach acceptable values.
